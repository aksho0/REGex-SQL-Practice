# REGex SQL Practice

A continuously expanding repository of SQL practice scripts focused on pattern matching, text filtering, and regular‑expression‑style logic. The collection is designed for ongoing learning, with new queries added over time.

## Overview

This project provides ready-to-run SQL examples that demonstrate how to use text search operators, special characters, and pattern logic. It is useful for learners who want to strengthen their understanding of SQL string-matching techniques.

## Contents

Current items include:

* Pattern-based SQL queries
* Examples using `LIKE`, wildcards, and character filters
* Beginner-friendly exercises for string conditions

Upcoming additions:

* More advanced search patterns
* Multi-condition REGEX-style tasks
* Scenario-based SQL challenges

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/aksho0/REGex-SQL-Practice.git
cd REGex-SQL-Practice
```

### 2. Open the SQL Files

Use any SQL client or local database tool to execute the scripts.

### 3. Run Queries

The scripts are compatible with common SQL engines. Adjust syntax if required by your environment.

## Usage

* Copy queries directly into your SQL console.
* Modify patterns to experiment with custom search logic.
* Use files as reference material during learning or revision.

## Roadmap

* Additional query sets
* More complex pattern-matching tasks
* Scenario-based SQL exercises
